# 🎮 UrGotPicked

> Can't decide who's playing and what role they should take? Let Urgot handle your team drama!

## What's This?

UrGotPicked is a fun team picker for League of Legends that solves two eternal questions:
1. Who's actually playing tonight? (when you have too many friends online)
2. Who's going to which lane? (without the usual "mid or feed" drama)

### 🎯 Features

- **Multiple Team Modes**
  - DUO (2 players) - Perfect for bot lane besties
  - TRIO (3 players) - Top-side trio action
  - FLEX (5 players) - Full team experience
  - CUSTOM (5 players, role-free chaos!)

- **Two Ways to Pick**
  - 🎡 Spin the Wheel - Watch your friends' fate spin before their eyes
  - ⚡ Rapid Pick - Quick and dirty team formation

### 🎲 How It Works

1. Choose your team size
2. Add all your available friends to the wheel
3. Let the wheel decide who plays and where
4. No takebacks - Urgot has spoken!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with React + TypeScript, because we take this business seriously!

## 🎨 Style

Rocking that toxic green Urgot theme, because who doesn't want their role picker to look like it came straight from Zaun?
